Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a 2nd year sociology & journalism student at Lehigh Univeristy. I am originally from "the shore", but moved to North Jersey before the start of my freshman year of college. I enjoy listening to music, hanging out with friends, writing, and being outdoors. My mom is a professor at Lehigh, and I have one brother. I have no pets.

My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate, or Chunky Monkey from Ben & Jerrys. My current favorite song is "Song About Me" by TV girl. My dream is to travel the world, and hope I can visit more places than I already have in the next 5 years. My favorite place I have ever been is London, England. My favorite clothing store is "Garage".
