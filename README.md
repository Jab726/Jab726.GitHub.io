Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a 2nd year sociology & journalism student at Lehigh Univeristy. I am originally from "the shore", but moved to North Jersey before the start of my freshman year of college. I enjoy listening to music, hanging out with friends, writing, and being outdoors. My mom is a professor at Lehigh, and I have one brother. I have no pets.

My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate, or Chunky Monkey from Ben & Jerrys. My current favorite song is "Song About Me" by TV girl. My dream is to travel the world, and hope I can visit more places than I already have in the next 5 years. My favorite place I have ever been is London, England. My favorite clothing store is "Garage".

# Safest Places for Women to Visit as Solo Travelers

![Safest Places to visit](https://github.com/Jab726/Jab726.GitHub.io/blob/main/Safest%20Places%20to%20visit.png?raw=true)

[Source](https://usebounce.com/blog/womens-solo-travel-safety-2023)

The saftey index was calculated based on 6 factors of each country. The percentage of women who have experienced domestic violence, female homicide vicitms, percentage of women who feel safe walking home alone at night, percentage of women who agree domestic violence is justified, qaulity of laws on domestic violence, and the wage gender gap. The data was taken from OECD data, the World Bank, and the Global Gender Gap report. Bounce published this study. The key finding was that the safest destinatons for female solo travelers are in Europe. Some countries have factors that rank well, but do not make them the safest country due to other factors. In example of this in the study is Turkey, as it has some of the most strict domestic violence laws. However, other factors that went into the saftey index prevented Turkey from being one of the top 10 safe countries.
# Timeline Project

My timeline project is on the history of the Russian-Ukrainan War. Rather than delving into the history of the Soviet Union, this timeline explores the start of tension between Russia and Ukraine. The timeline begins in the early 90s, and goes on to today, as this is an ongoing war. Most of my data was taken from US World News, as they published a timeline about a similar topic. Some of my knowledge on history and current events was also used in this timeline, as I am Russian and Ukrianian so the conflcit is personal and relevant to me.

# Chart Builder Project

In this project, we were asked to design a chart using Chart Builder. I chose to do music streams, based on the billions of streams the top 5 artists in the world have acquired. My data came from Chartmasters.org, which is an offcial orginization that specializes in collecting music data. The top five artists worldwide are on the X axis, while the number of streams is displayed on the Y axis.

# Google My Map Project

For this project, I decided to map the most popular cities based on the respective amount of tourism traffic they get each year. This is measured by the amount of visitors each city has. I got my data from the official UN tourism site. I decided to focus on the five most popular destinations.
