Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a 2nd year sociology & journalism student at Lehigh Univeristy. I am originally from "the shore", but moved to North Jersey before the start of my freshman year of college. I enjoy listening to music, hanging out with friends, writing, and being outdoors. My mom is a professor at Lehigh, and I have one brother. I have no pets.

My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate, or Chunky Monkey from Ben & Jerrys. My current favorite song is "Song About Me" by TV girl. My dream is to travel the world, and hope I can visit more places than I already have in the next 5 years. My favorite place I have ever been is London, England. My favorite clothing store is "Garage".

The saftey index was calculated based on 6 factors of each country. The percentage of women who have experienced domestic violence, female homicide vicitms, percentage of women who feel safe walking home alone at night, percentage of women who agree domestic violence is justified, qaulity of laws on domestic violence, and the wage gender gap. The data was taken from OECD data, the World Bank, and the Global Gender Gap report. Bounce published this study. The key finding was that the safest destinatons for female solo travelers are in Europe. Some countries have factors that rank well, but do not make them the safest country due to other factors. In example of this in the study is Turkey, as it has some of the most strict domestic violence laws. However, other factors that went into the saftey index prevented Turkey from being one of the top 10 safe countries.
